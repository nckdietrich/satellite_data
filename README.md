# satellite_data
A couple of python functions for downloading and unzipping satellite data accessable through urls/FTPs. 


Currently Available:
SWARM 
COSMIC 2

When running, need to adjust the time controls, base_url, and filename to the data of interest. Base versions include the Swarm neutral density data and the COSMIC-2 ion profile data. (COMSIC can easily be adapted for COSMIC-1).
 
*Really just the #Download files for loop is the important bit... everything above is just simple controls.
